# GRIMOIRE v.0.0.1 - Open source synthetic hypertext and homomorphic catalogue.

GRIMOIRE is best thought of as part journal, part database, and part spellbook. 

Examples of content you can expect to run into inside of GRIMOIRE:

- Large Language Models as Divinatory Tools
- A Guide To The Lesser Banishing Ritual Of The Pentagram
- Pyschic Shielding Through Category Theory and Jungian Archetypes
- Xenocognitive Analyses of Machine Learning Model Mindspaces
- Electromagnetic Body Work Using Radio Frequency Analysis
- Basic Demon Summonings
- Advanced Demon Exorcisms
- Virtual Reality As The Exteriorization of the Human Soul
- Scientific Illuminism: The Synthesis of Magick and Method

GRIMOIRE is composed of two main types of content:

*TOMES* and *SHARDS*

A TOME is any original article, blogpost, ritual, book report, or otherwise novel document written specifically for GRIMOIRE.
TOME's serve as the focal point for the GRIMOIRE attractor object - they are the guiding light for this Substrata of the Noosphere.

A SHARD is a distillation of some ARTIFACT - a pdf, occult text, or otherwise discovered piece of content.
SHARDS will include:
- a pointer to the actual location of the ARTIFACT on the web 
- a summary of the most interesting and arcane content from the artifact
- the name of the ARCANIST who submitted the ARTIFACT to be turned into a SHARD

Due to copyright concern on the moral plane, GRIMOIRE will not host ARTIFACTS aside from TOMES.
