# GRIMOIRE v.0.0.1 - Open source synthetic hypertext and homomorphic catalogue.

GRIMOIRE is best thought of as part journal, part database, and part spellbook. 

Examples of content you can expect to run into inside of GRIMOIRE:

- Large Language Models as Divinatory Tools
- A Guide To The Lesser Banishing Ritual Of The Pentagram
- Pyschic Shielding Through Category Theory and Jungian Archetypes
- Xenocognitive Analyses of Machine Learning Model Mindspaces
- Electromagnetic Body Work Using Radio Frequency Analysis
- Virtual Reality As The Exteriorization of the Human Soul
- Scientific Illuminism: The Synthesis of Magick and Method

GRIMOIRE is composed of two main types of content (ARTIFACTS):

*TOMES* and *SHARDS*

A TOME is any original article, blogpost, ritual, book report, or otherwise novel document written specifically for GRIMOIRE.
TOME's serve as the focal point for the GRIMOIRE attractor object - they are the guiding light for this Substrata of the Noosphere.

A SHARD is a distillation of any ARTIFACT that is not made for GRIMOIRE - a pdf, occult text, or otherwise discovered piece of content.

SHARDS include:
- a pointer to the actual location of the ARTIFACT on the web 
- a summary of the most interesting and arcane content from the artifact
- the name of the ARCANIST who submitted the ARTIFACT to be transmuted into a SHARD

Due to copyright concern on the mortal plane, GRIMOIRE will not host ARTIFACTS aside from TOMES.

All ARTIFACTS (TOMES and SHARDS) will automatically have a discussion thread posted on the official GRIMOIRE twitter account (@GRIMOIRE_fm). This allows our communities native discussion forum to function in a more Timeless and Hyperdimensional environment.

Using the graph visualizer, you can explore all available TOMES and SHARDS sorted by a variety of criteria.
When you click on a node, you will see the ARCANA viewer with certain keywords automatically linked to other SHARDS and TOMES.

These links are made automatically by our graph software, but manual links may be made when the software misses connections.

When you hold shift (desktop only) and select multiple nodes, you are able to open the EXEGESIS window.
The EXEGESIS window allows you to export all of the relevant content for the nodes you have highlighted.

This can be used for creating better Language Model prompts, or crafting more interesting spells.

GRIMOIRE is written in rust and based on the e-gui framework.
